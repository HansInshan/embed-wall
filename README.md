Cooliris Embed Wall
==========

# About

The Embed Wall was developed to enable web publishers to present photo and video content using the Cooliris Wall user interface, using a Flash-based widget. The widget fetches a collection from a supported source, and enables users to browse, view, and play slideshows of the photos and videos.

Originally, web publishers pointed at a centrally-hosted version of the Embed Wall SWF. While the product is no longer maintained, many web properties depend on it, so we are making the SWF available for self-hosting.

To continue to use the Embed Wall:
1. Upload [cooliris.swf](cooliris.swf) to your own web server.
